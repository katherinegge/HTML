HTML

My focused aspect of the project is extra CCS in my stylesheet and keeping the styling consistent across all my pages. I also put emphasized layout and design by adding a navigation bar, paying attention to layout on the Volleyballs page, and trying to keep the aesthetics cohesive.

BOOTSTRAP 5

My five elements selected from the list were:
1) A carousel in the Positions page with photos of each of the 6 positions.
2) A button in the footer that links to the Bishop's website.
3) A spinner after the Jump to Top link in the footer.
4) A collapsible in the How to Play page for rules of hitting a ball out.
5) An alert at the top of the Volleyballs page.

My two extra elements not included in the list are:
1) An accordion in the How to Play page on differences between Men's/Women's volleyball.
2) A shadow on the alert and on the Buy Now buttons on the Volleyballs page.
